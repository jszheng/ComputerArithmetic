Appendix: Past, Present, and Future



“Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.”
GEORG ORWELL



In this appendix, we trace the history of computer arithmetic, from the earliest digital computers to the modern machines that permeate ourdaily lives.We present a few turning points along this amazing chain of events, including the development of early supercomputers,the role played by vector supercomputers (particularly,their contributions to advances in pipelining), the arrival of digital signal processors, and the distillation of all these advanced developments into the tiny processors that power our desktop and laptop computers.We conclude with a discussion of current trends, future outlook, and resources for further study of computer arithmetic.
